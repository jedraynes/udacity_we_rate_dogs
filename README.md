# Udacity Project: WeRateDogs Data Wrangling
This project is part of the [Data and Analytics (Data Analyst) Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

Data is sourced in three formats: CSV, TSV, and via the Twitter API. The CSV and TSV were provided and thus were read in using Pandas. The Twitter API data was gathered using Tweepy.

The data was gathered, assessed, and cleaned prior to analysis. Afterwhich, two final reports were completed: one report formed as an internal document outlining the data wrangling completed and a second report formed as an external document where insights and visualization were reported.

Packages used: tweepy, pandas, numpy, requests, json, matplotlib, timeit.

Languages used: Python via Jupyter Notebook.
